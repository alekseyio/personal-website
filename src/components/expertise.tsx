      <p>
        <span className="font-medium text-black">Frontend.</span> I&apos;ve crafted a
        decent variety of digital applications, from sleek landing pages to dynamic web
        apps loaded with all sorts of functionalities. I primarily use React & Next.js
        but open to new things too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="font-medium text-black">Backend.</span> I&apos;ve contributed
        to lots of services ranging from simple REST APIs to complex web socket
        applications while working with both SQL and NoSQL databases. My main stack is
        Node.js & Go alongside a SQL database.

      <p>
        <span className="font-medium text-black">This</span>, by all means, is not a
        comprehensive list of skills I possess or tools I&apos;ve used in the past. I
        easily adapt to any technological stack or set of tools used within a team. At
        the end of the day, I believe it&apos;s more valuable to know the concepts and
        be able to adapt rather than learning languages and frameworks by heart.
